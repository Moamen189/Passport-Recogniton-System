This Project represents a guide to using the project, as 
well as clarifying what is behind the scenes of the project, 
as well as the use of the project in many areas and 
places.
The system aims to make passport recognition and 
validation processes more efficient with more facilities 
and capabilities in order to reduce time, effort, and other 
resources.
The main reason for this system is to facilitate the 
processes of identifying the person through the passport 
or verifying the validity of the passport, by making these 
processes automated and isolated to leave most of the 
available space for the rest of the requirements of the 
place in which this system operates, whether it is a 
company, airport, or port... Etc., to obtain optimal use of 
the resources available for the place in which the system 
operates.
In order to have the system in its most complex form, this 
requires going through several versions of software 
development and documentation of user and system 
requirements to achieve customer satisfaction within the 
available resources and budget.

The following points explain the different visions of the 
system that differentiate it and distinguish it from the 
previous systems:
1- Using a simple and smart graphical user interface 
with temporary data records instead of designing and 
implementing the actual database through the DBMS 
to make things easier and simpler for the user.
2- Integrating the graphic user interface of the 
system with an external database located on a 
server of the company or place that uses the system.
3- All previous versions were based on uploading 
passport photos to the website for verification in this 
version we add a feature that the user can take a live 
passport photo in real time.
4- Maintaining system security and stability issues, 
ensuring that the system works in a normal and 
stable manner, and resolving errors and problems 
facing the system.
